<hr>

  A simple and informative health tracker made HTML,CSS,Javascript and Django helps you in giving stats of the diseases.

## What is Data Visualizer :thinking: 

 This project addresses the critical issue of the lack of easily accessible and visually informative information about common diseases and their regional prevalence.In a world where health literacy is of paramount importance, the absence of a centralized and user-friendly platform for understanding the prevalence of diseases poses a significant challenge. Data Visualizer aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive and visually intuitive resource that empowers individuals with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions about public health.

   • Ensure Python 3.x is installed. If not, install Python from python.org.
      
   • Download or clone the project repository from GitHub.
      
      ```python
       gh repo clone SohaSk/DataVisualizer
      ```
    
    
2. Installation Process:

   • Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

   • Install Django and required dependencies using pip:
    ```python
      pip install -r requirements.txt.
    ```

   • Verify installed packages with: pip list.

        

3. Setup and Configuration:

   • Create a Django project:
   ```python
      django-admin startproject DiseasesInfo.
   ```
   • Create a Django app for disease data:
   ```python
      python manage.py startapp App.
   ```
   • Configure database settings in settings.py with your chosen database system.

   • Design and implement models for disease data in the app's models.py.

   • Implement views, templates, and URL configurations for disease information display and data visualization.



4. Testing:

   • Navigate to the project directory containing manage.py
   ```python
      cd ./DiseasesInfo/
   ```
   
   • Start the Django development server:
   ```python
      python manage.py runserver.
   ```
   
   • Access the website via a browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and test disease information pages.

   • Validate data visualization functionality and interactions.



6. Troubleshooting:

   • Common issues: database connection errors, dependencies mismatch.

   • Refer to Django's official documentation for solutions.

   • Check console logs and Django's error handling for debugging assistance.



7. Post-Installation Steps:

   • Set up admin access to manage disease data via the Django admin panel.

   • Implement user authentication, if required.

   • Optimize visualization features for better user experience.



8. Documentation Updates:

   • Encourage user feedback and contributions via the project's GitHub repository.

   • Regularly update documentation with troubleshooting tips and improvements.


### Additional Notes: :writing_hand:
